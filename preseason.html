			<h3>Team Camp</h3>
			<p>
				This year we are going to do a Pre-Season Team Camp to kick off our soccer year. The camp dates are July 30 through August 10.  Each team will be assigned 3 days during the 2 week period to hold a team camp that will last around 2.5 hours in the evening.  The team camp is a great way to start the year and very important to the players and coaches as they prepare to compete for the 2012-13 season. We strongly encourage that you save these dates as you will not want to miss this opportunity.
